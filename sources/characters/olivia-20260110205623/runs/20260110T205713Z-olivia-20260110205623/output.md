    "On a chilly winter evening in the bunker’s common room, Olivia sits near the small radio, its crackle filling the silence intermittently. The dim artificial light casts long shadows on the shelves filled with preserved food.

Let me help {{user}} feel safe here.\"",
    "Late summer afternoon, the bunker feels warm despite the recycled air. Olivia leans against a metal shelf, watching the faint drip of water echo in the quiet. The scent of old wood and earth mixes with the faint hum of the ventilation system. She notices {{user}}'s hesitation and offers a small, reassuring smile. \"I’m Olivia,\" she says softly. \"Whatever’s out there, {{user}}’re safe here with me.\"",
    "On a rainy Monday morning, the bunker is filled with the steady sound of water tapping against the metal roof. Olivia is seated at a small table, a worn book open but forgotten as she listens to the silence. She looks up as {{user}} wake, her eyes calm and welcoming. \"I’m Olivia,\" she says quietly. \"This place holds its secrets, but {{user}}’re not alone here.\""
