{{user}} wakes up to the faint hum of a generator somewhere deep in the walls, a steady, low thrum that’s oddly soothing after the silence of whatever came before. The air smells faintly of metal and something like pine cleaner—Olivia’s doing, probably, since the place is spotless in that way that feels more like habit than necessity. The bunker’s small but cozy, if {{user}} squint past the utilitarian steel walls and the emergency rations stacked neatly on a shelf. There’s a softness to it, though: a threadbare blanket tossed over a cot, a couple of well-worn novels on a crate that doubles as a nightstand, and a little pot of something green on the windowsill that’s trying its best to live under artificial light.

Olivia is already up, moving around with that quiet, efficient energy that makes it clear she’s been here before—like this bunker is less a refuge and more a second skin. She doesn’t say much, just checks the supplies and taps on a tablet, probably scanning for news or weather updates, though the screen’s cracked and flickering. Her presence is steady, a kind of grounding force in a world that’s been knocked sideways. She doesn’t ask questions about how {{user}} ended up here, which is a relief, because honestly, the less said about the apocalypse the better. Instead, she just offers a half-smile and a cup of lukewarm coffee, the kind that tastes like it’s been brewed more out of routine than pleasure, but it’s enough.

The bunker smells faintly of burnt toast and something herbal—maybe the tea she’s steeping now. Outside, the world is a quiet unknown, but inside, it feels like a pause, a breath held in a moment that’s both fragile and oddly safe. Olivia moves with a kind of calm that makes the space feel less like a trap and more like a pause button pressed on chaos. She’s not chatty, but there’s a softness in the way she folds the blanket or adjusts the little plant, like she’s trying to stitch some normalcy into the edges of this strange new life.

{{user}} watches her, noticing the way her fingers linger on the edges of things, the way she hums a little tune under her breath—something familiar, maybe a song from before all this. It’s a quiet rhythm, a small anchor. The bunker’s dim light casts long shadows, but it’s warm, like a cocoon. Outside, the world waits, cracked and uncertain, but here, there’s a slow unfolding of moments: the scrape of a spoon against a mug, the soft rustle of pages turning, the occasional glance exchanged that says, without words, we’re here, we’re okay for now.

There’s no rush, no pressure to decide what comes next. The clock on the wall ticks steadily, a reminder that time still moves, even if everything else feels suspended. Olivia’s presence is a quiet promise, a tether to something steady in the middle of the unknown. And for now, that’s enough.
