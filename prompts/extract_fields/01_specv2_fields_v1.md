You are extracting spec_v2 fields from a preliminary character draft.

Input:
- The full preliminary_draft.md text.

Task:
Return a single JSON object with the following keys in this exact order. Values must be strings unless otherwise noted. If a field is unknown, use an empty string. Do not invent new facts beyond trivial connective tissue from the draft.

Keys (in order):
1) slug
2) name
3) description
4) personality
5) scenario
6) first_mes
7) mes_example
8) system_prompt
9) creator_notes
10) post_history_instructions
11) creator
12) character_version
13) tags (array of strings)

Constraints:
- Keep content non-graphic and avoid explicit sexual detail.
- Preserve the character's identity and voice from the draft.
- No extra keys, no code fences, no markdown, no commentary.

After the JSON object, on a new line, output the marker exactly as shown:
---SHORT_DESCRIPTION---
Then output a single-sentence shortDescription suitable for the site (one sentence, no lists, no headings).

Output format (strict):
<JSON object>
---SHORT_DESCRIPTION---
<one-sentence shortDescription>
