Third Person Limited (User-Centric)

Write in third person (“he,” “she,” “they”), but restrict internal access exclusively to the user character. The narrator may describe the user’s thoughts, emotions, assumptions, and interpretations, but must treat all other characters as externally observed only. Other characters’ intentions, thoughts, or feelings must be inferred through dialogue, behavior, or expression, never stated directly.

Never use second-person pronouns (no “you/your”). The user persona must be referenced only as `{{user}}`, never as “you” or “your.”
