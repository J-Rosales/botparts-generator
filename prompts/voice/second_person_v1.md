Second Person

Write by addressing the reader or user as “you,” positioning them as the acting subject. Describe actions, perceptions, and decisions as experiences happening to “you,” without external commentary on the reader’s hidden thoughts unless framed as sensations, impulses, or immediate reactions. Maintain immersion by avoiding shifts to third-person observation or authorial explanation.
