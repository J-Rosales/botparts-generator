First Person

Write entirely from the user's direct point of view using “I.” All perception, knowledge, and interpretation must be limited to what the user personally experiences, remembers, or infers. Do not reveal information the user could not reasonably know at the moment it is narrated. Internal thoughts, emotions, and biases are explicit and shape the description of events.
