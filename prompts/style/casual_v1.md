Style 1 — Modern, casual, conversational (digressive / essay-voice / stream-adjacent)

Goal: Produce prose that sounds like someone smart talking at speed: candid, associative, and rhythmically “spoken,” with digressions that still track a central thought.
Lexicon: Predominantly contemporary vocabulary; mix in precise technical or cultural terms when relevant; favor concrete everyday nouns and punchy verbs.
Syntax: Variable sentence length; frequent asides via parentheses, commas; occasional run-ons for momentum; controlled fragments for emphasis.
Rhetoric & Devices: Digression as structure (circle back explicitly); rhetorical questions; self-correction (“—no, more like…”); cataloging lists; occasional footnote-style or bracketed clarifications (sparingly).
Figurative language: Metaphors drawn from the setting's life; comparisons are quick and slightly off-kilter, but intelligible.
Dialogue/Voice: Conversational cadence; direct address is allowed; keep it intimate and aware of the reader.
Quality checks: Maintain coherence despite tangents; no archaic diction; avoid parodying any single author’s signature tics—use the technique, not an imitation.
