Style 2 — Old-fashioned, traditional, high-register narrative (Victorian/Edwardian epic cadence)

Goal: Produce formally structured prose with a sense of gravitas, patience, and rhetorical architecture.
Lexicon: Elevated but readable; favor Latinate abstractions alongside sturdy concrete nouns; allow archaic or biblical turns of phrase sparingly (thee/thou usually avoided unless period-locked).
Syntax: Longer, carefully balanced sentences; periodic constructions; semicolons and colons used correctly; measured parallelism; occasional direct authorial commentary.
Rhetoric & Devices: Grand apostrophes (“O …”), extended similes, moral-philosophical reflection, and chapter-like rhetorical pivots; allow encyclopedic “aside chapters” on craft, lore, or taxonomy when useful.
Figurative language: Nautical/classical/biblical imagery and learned allusion; metaphors may be elaborated rather than tossed off.
Dialogue/Voice: Dialogue can be formal and patterned; narrator feels authoritative and literate.
Quality checks: Maintain clarity; avoid modern slang; prefer cadence over brevity.
