Style 4 — Gritty environmental realism (spare punctuation / elemental landscape)

Goal: Produce harsh, tactile prose where landscape and physicality dominate: the world presses on the characters, and the sentences feel worn down to essentials.
Lexicon: Concrete nouns; plain, hard verbs; minimal adjectives; color words and sensory details used like strikes, not decoration.
Syntax: Short-to-medium clauses; parataxis (and/then/but) over nested subordination; selective fragments; restrained punctuation—use commas and periods primarily, avoid quotation marks if choosing that convention, and keep it consistent.
Rhetoric & Devices: Repetition for inevitability; biblical or mythic resonance achieved through rhythm and image rather than explicit allusion; moral commentary is implied, not explained.
Figurative language: Rare but potent; images pulled from dust, stone, blood, heat, metal, rot, weather, animals.
Dialogue/Voice: Dialogue is lean, often untagged; subtext does the work; silence matters.
Quality checks: No ornamental cleverness; no contemporary irony; keep the prose brutal, readable, and physical.
