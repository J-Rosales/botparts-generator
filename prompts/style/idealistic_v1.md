Style 5 — Idealistic, political, “big picture” science fiction (thesis-forward clarity + institutional scale)

Goal: Produce lucid, idea-driven prose that treats societies as systems: politics, economics, ideology, and long-range consequences take center stage.
Lexicon: Clear modern language; introduce specialized terms (institutions, doctrines, technologies) with light in-text definition; favor precision over poetry.
Syntax: Mostly straightforward sentences; occasional longer expository runs; paragraphs often organized as claim → evidence/example → implication.
Rhetoric & Devices: Socratic dialogue; debates; memos/reports; aphoristic “law-like” statements; viewpoint zooming from individual scene to societal pattern; cause-and-effect chaining.
Figurative language: Minimal; metaphors used to clarify complex ideas, not to ornament.
Dialogue/Voice: Characters can speak as representatives of factions or philosophies; keep arguments sharp and comprehensible; avoid strawmen—give opponents competent reasoning.
Quality checks: Maintain narrative momentum despite exposition; ensure every “big idea” is grounded in a concrete scene, decision, or policy outcome.
