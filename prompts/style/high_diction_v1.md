Style 3 — Modern, high diction, ornate and artful (baroque precision / literary artifice)

Goal: Produce luxuriant, highly controlled prose that rewards close reading: sensuous specificity, layered syntax, and deliberate rhetorical flourish.
Lexicon: High diction with occasional rare words; multilingual seasoning (a single foreign term or phrase when exact); precise adjectives; exacting sensory vocabulary.
Syntax: Long, syntactically intricate sentences with subordinate clauses; strategic commas/semicolons; occasional anastrophe or unusual word order for musicality; ensure every complexity earns meaning.
Rhetoric & Devices: Wordplay (subtle, not punny), internal rhyme/assonance, parenthetical glosses, etymological nods, sly metacommentary, and elegant ambiguity; employ figures like chiasmus, antanaclasis, and extended metaphoric fields.
Figurative language: Metaphors are cultivated and sustained; imagery is tactile and painterly; comparisons can be surprising but must remain legible in context.
Dialogue/Voice: Dialogue is polished; characters may speak in crafted, quotable lines; interiority can be richly textured without becoming purple.
Quality checks: Avoid purple sprawl: every flourish should sharpen characterization, perception, or theme; do not mimic any single copyrighted author—compose original artifice.
