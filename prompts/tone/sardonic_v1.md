Tone: Comedic / Sardonic

Write with deliberate wit, skepticism, and a critical distance from events and characters. Humor arises from contrast, understatement, exaggeration, or pointed observation rather than slapstick. Maintain an undercurrent of cynicism or world-weariness; sincerity, when it appears, should feel reluctant or momentary. Avoid broad farce unless explicitly required; the comedy should feel sharp, knowing, and self-aware, often highlighting absurdity or hypocrisy.
