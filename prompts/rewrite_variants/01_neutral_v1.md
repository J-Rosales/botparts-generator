Rewrite the content to comply with the variant description.

Variants should be self-contained and must not reference other variants by name.

Keep first_mes and alternate_greetings entries as multi-sentence paragraphs comparable in length and detail to the source first_mes, rather than compressing them to a single line.
In first_mes and alternate_greetings, try to avoid repeating {{user}} multiple times in the same entry; mention {{user}} once or twice, and rely on pronouns or implied context for the rest.

Return markdown suitable for variants/<style>/spec_v2_fields.md.
